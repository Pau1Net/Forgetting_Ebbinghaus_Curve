> [!NOTE]
> I've created a design demo for the upcoming app! Feel free to check it out on the live page: [https://Pau1Net.github.io/Forgetting_Ebbinghaus_-urve/demo/forget_curve_demo.html](https://Pau1Net.github.io/Forgetting_Ebbinghaus_-urve/demo/forget_curve_demo.html)

"Forgetting Ebbinghaus Curve" (working title) is an open-source __iOS and macOS__ application for creating text-based notes (with plans to support other media types)
designed to enhance information retention based on the [Ebbinghaus forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).
The application is currently in early development stages, with core features yet to be implemented.
It's worth noting that this application will remain completely free and open-source throughout its development lifecycle and ongoing maintenance.
